# Polkadot Developer Bounties

Community Driven Development and Maintenance for the Polkadot Ecosystem

## Goals

Maintaining an ecosystem as large as the Polkadot Developer community is not easy!

Unlike more traditional developer ecosystems, the Polkadot community is entirely decentralized.
There are over 100 development teams all contributing to the Polkadot developer ecosystem.
This means that maintaining high quality developer documentation and resources is particularly difficult.

The goal of this repository is to coordinate and incentivize community driven development and maintenance of the Polkadot ecosystem.

Here, you will find ways to contribute to the Polkadot developer ecosystem, either by noting issues

## How

The Polkadot Developer Bounties is powered by the [Substrate Tip Bot](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-tip-bot).

The Substrate Tip Bot is a GitHub application which can make submit Tip proposals to the Polkadot treasury.
The tip bot is triggered by curators / owners of this repository, who will review evidence submitted to this repository.

## Rules

This project openly acknowledges that creating a system for rewarding people to submit and fix issues is ripe for abuse and grifting.

As such, it is important to establish rules defining the expected conduct around this initiative.

1. No asking for or discussion of payments.

2. Respect the opinions of the curator.

	The curators have full control over

3. No double dipping.

	Submitters should not be paid multiple times for doing the same work. This means that if you already received a tip or bounty reward for some fix, you should not submit it again here. Similarly, if you are an owner of an open source project and are being funded already, you should not submit another request here. This is really for community members to earn small rewards for actively
